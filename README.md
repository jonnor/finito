Finito State Machines
====================
An experiment in Finite State Machines (FSM),
making them introspectable, visually programmable and
relating them to Flow-based Programming (FBP).


Milestones
-----------
0.0.1: Statemachines for C/C++ can defined by .json, execute and be introspected
0.1.0: One can create components for MicroFlo using Finito
